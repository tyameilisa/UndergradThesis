The Correlation Between Planned Housing Development Archetype and Urban Morphology of Bogor Regency

The phenomenon of urban sprawling with predominantly random development occurs in Bogor Regency (Nugraha et al., 2021; Robbany et al., 2019; Prasetyo et al., 2017). 
Most of the development is for housing and residential purposes (Muhtadin & Winarso, 2024; Robbany et al., 2019; Hadi et al., 2023).
There is a connection between planned housing development and urban morphology, especially because Bogor Regency serves as one of the buffer zones in the Jabodetabekpunjur Agglomeration Area (Ikhsan & Pamungkas, 2023; Robbany et al., 2019). 
This study aims to explain the archetypes of planned housing and to identify correlations between the variables of these housing archetypes and urban morphology in Bogor Regency. 

 The formulation of the Planned Housing Archetypes uses K-Means Clustering analysis. 
 AwaP analysis is conducted to be used as one of the variables that compose the archetypes, namely permeability. 
 Space Syntax analysis is then performed to produce urban morphology variables, whose connection with the planned housing archetypes is assessed using Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation analysis.
